## Feature
By priority

### High
* Better http responses
* Use presenter to abstract `use_case` responses from `http responses`
* Document (with images) current architecture

### Medium
* Create player account
* Games by player
* Two player battleship game

### Low
* Persist player statistic over games
* Random placement bigger ships - now we only place single square
* Keep track if an entire ship was sinked (more than one square)

## Fix
* Random is always generating the same map
